There are several ways to defeat this crackme, one way would be to rebuild the obfuscation in a seperate c++ project and provide the desired username and make it output the correct password. (example below)

Another method to bypass this would be to patch the file and remove the for loop which would make the username == password removing the obfuscation or patch the jump statement to force it to success every attempt regardless of the password.



Another method which I dont reccomend would be to change the value of the obfuscated string via an external memory edit either in a c++ project or cheat engine or you can  make a DLL project and use that to edit the memory of the obfuscated string.



What the code does:
