In this crackme, its asking us for a password in which we dont know, what i did was run through main until I found a sort of comparison between two things and a result.

In this case it was hidden inside a function, ive renamed this function for simplicity.

I scroll through this function and I see that memcmp is called, this may be the password and our input being compared.

I set a breakpoint at this call and i see that there are two BUFs being compared.

When this breakpoint is hit I click on both RDX,RCX 

When I click on RDX this is what im shown:

This tells me that this us our input.


and this is RCX:

This tells me that the correct password is CrispyChicken when I restart the program and enter this in, I get a message telling me its correct.
